Association Mappings in Hibernate and Spring boot JPA

Q) How to create Spring Boot project by using Spring Initializer?
A) Go through link: https://start.spring.io/
Q) How to add Database and JPA properties in properties file or YML file?
   #Database configuration properties
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/associtionmp
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=root

   #JPA configuration properties:
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

Understanding a few JPA Annotations:
1.	@Entity : 
   entity annotation is mapped with a database table.
   It has one attribute name by using this attribute we can change the table name to our choice name.
2.	@Table: 
    we can change the table name, scheme, etc.
3.	@Id: 
   @Id is called the primary key.
   Every table must and should have one primary key.
   If we are using multiple @Id annotations in our entity class then it will be composite primary key.
4. Composite Primary Key:
    Composite primary key we can make by using multiple columns of a table.
5.	drop VS truncate:
   Truncate: truncate it will delete all rows from a table.
   Drop: it will delete all rows and will delete table structure also.
