Association Mappings in Hibernate and Spring boot JPA

Q) How to create Spring Boot project by using Spring Initializer?
A) Go through link: https://start.spring.io/
Q) How to add Database and JPA properties in properties file or YML file?
   #Database configuration properties
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/associtionmp
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=root

   #JPA configuration properties:
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

Understanding a few JPA Annotations:
1.	@Entity : 
   entity annotation is mapped with a database table.
   It has one attribute name by using this attribute we can change the table name to our choice name.
2.	@Table: 
    we can change the table name, scheme, etc.
3.	@Id: 
   @Id is called the primary key.
   Every table must and should have one primary key.
   If we are using multiple @Id annotations in our entity class then it will be composite primary key.
4. Composite Primary Key:
    Composite primary key we can make by using multiple columns of a table.
5.	drop VS truncate:
   Truncate: truncate it will delete all rows from a table.
   Drop: it will delete all rows and will delete table structure also. 

    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)//MySQL recommended
	//@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)//Oracle recommended
   @Id
	private Long id;
    @Column(name = "sname",length = 40,nullable = false)
	private String name;
    @Column(name = "snum1")
    private Long num1;

Q) what is FetchType?
A When to load or retrieve the child record.
  FetchType.LAZY: 
    Child records will not come when you load parent records. 
  FetchType.EAGER:
    If we want to retrieve child records along with parents then we have to use them. 

   @OneToOne default FetchType is EAGER
   @OneToMany default FetchType is LAZY
   @ManyToOne default FetchType is EAGER
   @ManyToMany default FetchType is LAZY

 Q) What is @JoinColumn?
    A) It is a Foreign key column, the parent table primary key is a foreign key in the child table.

 mappedBy:
    HAS-A is a variable in the child entity reference variable name mapped to the parent HAS-A variable field. 

What is cascade:
Cascade.ALL
Whatever operations are done by the parent will be reflected to the child.  

What is an Orphan Record?
A) If the child has no reference with the parent record then it is called an Orphan record.

What is join?
Retrieves the data from multiple tables at a time by using joinsâ€¦ joins supports only select statements. 
In association mappings, while retrieving records internally left join is used.
